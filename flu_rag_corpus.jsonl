{"id": "doc-001", "category": "flu_basics", "title": "What is seasonal influenza (flu)?", "tags": ["flu", "overview", "respiratory infection"], "text": "Seasonal influenza, commonly called the flu, is an acute respiratory infection caused mainly by influenza A and B viruses.\nIt affects the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs. Illness can range from mild to severe, and in high-risk people it can\nlead to complications such as pneumonia and hospitalisation."}
{"id": "doc-002", "category": "flu_basics", "title": "How the flu spreads between people", "tags": ["flu", "transmission", "droplets"], "text": "Flu spreads primarily through tiny droplets that are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.\nThese droplets can be inhaled by people nearby or land on surfaces such as doorknobs or phones. If someone touches\na contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, the virus can enter the body and cause infection."}
{"id": "doc-003", "category": "flu_basics", "title": "Incubation and contagious period of flu", "tags": ["flu", "incubation", "contagious"], "text": "After exposure to influenza virus, symptoms usually start within one to four days.\nPeople can be contagious one day before symptoms begin and up to about five to seven days after they start.\nYoung children and people with weakened immune systems may spread the virus for an even longer time."}
{"id": "doc-010", "category": "flu_symptoms", "title": "Typical flu symptoms in adults", "tags": ["flu", "symptoms", "adults"], "text": "Typical flu symptoms in adults include sudden onset of fever or feeling feverish with chills, a dry cough,\nsore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and marked tiredness.\nThese symptoms often come on quickly over the course of a day rather than building slowly."}
{"id": "doc-011", "category": "flu_symptoms", "title": "Gastrointestinal symptoms and flu", "tags": ["flu", "symptoms", "gastrointestinal"], "text": "Some people, especially children, may have nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea during a flu illness.\nThese gastrointestinal symptoms are usually accompanied by typical respiratory signs such as fever and cough,\nnot occurring in isolation."}
{"id": "doc-012", "category": "flu_symptoms", "title": "Duration of uncomplicated flu illness", "tags": ["flu", "course", "duration"], "text": "In most healthy people, uncomplicated flu improves within a few days to less than two weeks.\nHowever, the cough and feelings of fatigue can linger longer even after the fever has resolved.\nIf symptoms persist or suddenly worsen, it may indicate a complication such as pneumonia."}
{"id": "doc-013", "category": "flu_symptoms", "title": "Children and flu symptoms", "tags": ["flu", "children", "symptoms"], "text": "Children with the flu often show many of the same symptoms as adults, including fever, cough, sore throat and tiredness.\nThey may also be more likely to have ear pain, vomiting or diarrhoea. Very young children can simply appear irritable,\nfeed poorly or be less active than usual."}
{"id": "doc-014", "category": "flu_symptoms", "title": "Mild versus severe flu presentations", "tags": ["flu", "mild", "severe"], "text": "Some flu illnesses are mild, with low fever and a few respiratory symptoms, while others are more intense and exhausting.\nEven when symptoms are mild, people with underlying chronic conditions or who are pregnant can be at higher risk of complications\nand should consider early medical advice."}
{"id": "doc-020", "category": "comparison", "title": "Flu versus common cold", "tags": ["flu", "cold", "difference"], "text": "Both flu and the common cold can cause cough, sore throat and runny nose, but there are important differences.\nFlu usually starts suddenly and tends to cause higher fever, stronger body aches and more pronounced fatigue.\nColds often develop gradually and symptoms are milder, with people usually well enough to continue daily activities."}
{"id": "doc-021", "category": "comparison", "title": "Flu versus seasonal allergies", "tags": ["flu", "allergy", "difference"], "text": "Seasonal allergies are caused by the immune system reacting to things like pollen, not by a virus.\nAllergies commonly cause itchy eyes, itchy nose, sneezing and clear runny nose, but they do not usually cause fever or body aches.\nIn contrast, flu commonly causes fever, muscle aches and general sickness, and eye itching is less typical."}
{"id": "doc-022", "category": "comparison", "title": "When flu symptoms overlap with other illnesses", "tags": ["flu", "overlap", "respiratory"], "text": "Flu symptoms overlap with many other respiratory illnesses, including other viral infections.\nHaving fever and cough does not guarantee that a person has influenza specifically.\nLaboratory tests or clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional are often needed to confirm the exact cause."}
{"id": "doc-023", "category": "comparison", "title": "No single symptom proves flu", "tags": ["flu", "diagnosis", "symptoms"], "text": "No single symptom, such as fever or cough, can by itself prove that someone has the flu.\nClinicians look at the full pattern of symptoms, the time of year, local flu activity and sometimes test results.\nA simple screening tool or chatbot can only estimate similarity, not make a real diagnosis."}
{"id": "doc-024", "category": "comparison", "title": "Muscle aches and fatigue in flu", "tags": ["flu", "muscle aches", "fatigue"], "text": "Muscle or body aches and strong fatigue are very common in flu and often make people feel too exhausted to continue normal tasks.\nThese symptoms can also appear with other viral infections or with non-infectious problems such as over-exertion or poor sleep.\nConsidering other symptoms like fever and cough helps put them in context."}
